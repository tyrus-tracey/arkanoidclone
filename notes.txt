	loadLvl(lvlbook.readlvldata())

	loadLvl(lvlData) {

		lvl.walls = lvlData.walls

lvlbook.cpp
	lvldatastruct readlvldata() const;

lvldatastruct
- wallsize
- coreloc
- ballloc and direction
- vector<brick*> bricks


1. lvlparams instance created in lvlbook
2. game.cpp sets level by reading in params from lvlbook
3. level sets wallsize/ballspawn/etc. based on params
4. level instructs its brickMan to add bricks from params brickvector
5. brickMan sets brickPos relative to lvlWalls, checks if its within bounds, then adds to its brickvector



Obstacles:
[issue] abstract brick means use of brick pointers and mem. management
[issue] encapsulation making derived brick classes annoying to handle

//template <class brickType>
//void level::addBrick(const gridLocation loc)
//{
//	if (!std::is_base_of_v<brick, brickType>) {
//		return;
//	}
//	Vec2 pos = loc2pos(loc);
//	brickType* b = new brickType;
//	b->setPos(pos);
//	brickMan.addBrick(b, lvlWalls);
//}
//template void level::addBrick<redBrick>(const gridLocation loc);
//template void level::addBrick<blueBrick>(const gridLocation loc);


Log:
- just added copyconstructor/assignment op to brickMan
- builds and runs fine, but somewhere the initList from levelParams doesn't turn into rendered bricks.
	- fixed: level datamember order had brickman initialize before params, this was reversed.
